/**
 * Factory class for creating graph iterators.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Graph iterators created by factories implementing this interface iterate over the nodes of a graph in proper sequence as requested (e.g. <b>BFS</b> or <b>DFS</b>).
 * 
 * Adjacent nodes of the graph node returned by the last call to {@link java.util.Iterator#next() next()} are always provided in the order they were added to the adjacency list (unless they have already been processed).
 * 
 * The iterators always start at the first node of the graphs node list. If the graph is <i>disconnected or weakly connected</i>, the nodes of the <b>remaining components</b> are provided in the order their nodes appear in the graphs node list (unless they have already been processed).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The nodes provided by the iterator reflect the state of the graph at the time, the factory method was called.
 * 
 * If the graph is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, the view of the iterator remains unchanged. Note that this behavior is <b>neither thread-safe nor fail-fast</b> !
